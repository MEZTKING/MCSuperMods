# MCSuperMods examples

Ordinary MSM projects generated from the built-in templates and samples library (`@msm/plugin-library`, ADR 0020). The same content is in the app: Help > Examples… opens the Examples gallery, and the New project dialog lists the starters.

| Folder | Namespace | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| `all-kinds/` | `msm_examples` | One commented example for every element kind of the resource pack and data pack plugins (30 examples in one project) |
| `starters/custom_ore/` | `msm_starter` | The Custom ore starter: emerald ore reskinned as "Ruby Ore", with textures, models, a loot table, a recipe, an item tag and advancements |
| `starters/recipe_pack/` | `msm_starter` | The Recipe pack starter: shaped, shapeless, smelting, blasting and stonecutting recipes, an item tag and an advancement |
| `starters/music_disc/` | `msm_starter` | The Custom music disc starter: a jukebox song, its sound event, disc model and texture, and a function that gives the disc |
| `starters/function_starter/` | `msm_starter` | The Functions starter: load and tick functions, the vanilla function tags and a function tag of its own |

Every element carries notes (`meta.notes`) explaining its fields; the app shows them above the editor.

## Opening an example

1. Copy the folder somewhere outside this repository, so your edits do not change the mirror.
2. In MCSuperMods choose File > Open Project… and pick the copied folder.
3. Export the resource pack and data pack as usual and try them in game.

The textures are generated placeholders, not Mojang assets. The music disc plays the vanilla `records/cat` track until you import your own `.ogg` and point the sound event at it.

## Regenerating

These folders are generated. Do not edit them by hand: change the library in `packages/plugins/library/src/`, then run

```sh
UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 pnpm --filter @msm/exporters exec vitest run test/library.test.ts
```

`packages/exporters/test/library.test.ts` fails when the folders drift from the library. It also loads every starter and example with the real plugins, validates every element, checks every function and exports both packs with zero problems for each built-in target. `biome.json` here turns off formatting of the generated JSON, which MSM writes in its own stable format.
