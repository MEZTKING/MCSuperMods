# MCSuperMods

A desktop mod maker for Minecraft Java Edition that takes you from a simple texture pack to fully animated custom mobs, without forcing you to write code.

## What it is

- **Every content layer in one project:** resource packs, data packs, structures, worldgen, custom blocks and items, and Blockbench-animated entities.
- **Fabric-first, vanilla where possible:** content that vanilla can express exports as plain resource and data packs; anything beyond that ships as a single Fabric jar.
- **For beginners and power users alike:** guided "Studio" views with live 3D preview, plus a Raw JSON tab, mcfunction and TypeScript editors, and an eject-to-Java escape hatch.

## Status

- Pre-alpha: documentation phase. There is no code and there are no releases yet.
- Current Minecraft target: **Java 26.3** (with 26.2 as the previous supported release at launch).

## How it works

1. Your project is a git-friendly folder of JSON elements: a version-agnostic intermediate representation (IR).
2. Plugins define element kinds; each kind **lowers** to plain files for a specific Minecraft version (a **target**).
3. Lowered output is validated against the official mcdoc schemas via Spyglass before anything is written.
4. Exporters then produce vanilla packs, or a Fabric **content jar** that bundles the generic `msm_runtime` mod, or an ejected standalone Fabric Java project.
5. Version churn stays inside target packages, so moving a project to a new Minecraft release does not mean rewriting it.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Name | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Foundations | Project model, schemas and app shell; CI green |
| 1 | Resource Pack Studio (v0.1) | Make and install a custom texture and model pack without touching JSON |
| 2 | Data Pack Studio (v0.2) | Recipes, loot, advancements, tags and validated mcfunctions |
| 3 | Structures & Worldgen (v0.3) | Custom biomes with custom jigsaw structures |
| 4 | Engine Mod + Blocks/Items (v0.4) | Custom blocks and items with behaviour, from one jar |
| 5 | Entities, Models, Animation (v0.5) | Blockbench-animated custom mobs |
| 6 | Scripting & Eject (v0.6) | TypeScript scripts in-game; export as a Java project |
| 7 | 1.0 | Third-party plugins, a second Minecraft target, docs site |

## Comparison

| Tool | What it does well | How MCSuperMods differs |
|---|---|---|
| MCreator | Mature, large beginner community | Forge/NeoForge-first with generated-code lock-in; MSM keeps a version-agnostic project, exports true vanilla packs, and offers an open plugin API and real code escape hatches |
| Blockbench | Best-in-class model and animation authoring | A partner, not a competitor: MSM imports `.bbmodel` files rather than re-implementing a modeller |
| Misode generators | Fast, accurate web generators for data pack files | One file at a time with no project; MSM uses the same schema ecosystem inside a full project with export and in-game testing |

## Development

Requires Node 22.18 or later (see `.nvmrc`) and pnpm 10.28.0 via corepack.

```sh
corepack enable                     # use the pinned pnpm
pnpm i                              # install dependencies
pnpm dev                            # run the desktop app
pnpm lint                           # Biome check plus the dependency-direction check
pnpm typecheck                      # tsc -b over all project references
pnpm test                           # unit tests (Vitest)
pnpm build                          # build the app
pnpm --filter @msm/core test        # tests for one package
```

Vendored Minecraft data is refreshed only by `tools/sync-mcdoc` and `tools/sync-mcmeta`; each has a README with its arguments. The `msm_runtime` engine mod (`cd engine-mod && ./gradlew build`) arrives in Phase 4.

Planned stack: Electron + TypeScript + React for the app; Fabric + Java 25 for the runtime mod. See [Tech Stack](docs/DESIGN.md#14-tech-stack) and [Repository Layout](docs/DESIGN.md#15-repository-layout).

## Contributing

Not open for contributions yet while the architecture settles. Issues with ideas, questions or use cases are welcome.

## Licence

To be decided. The current recommendation is MIT for the app and `@msm/plugin-api`, and LGPL or MIT for the `msm_runtime` mod. This is tracked as an [open question](docs/DESIGN.md#18-open-questions).
