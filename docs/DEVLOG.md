## 2026-11-03 — main session — Project scoping question

**What**
- The repository contained only a placeholder README.
- The user asked for the scope and feasibility of a full-customisability mod maker for Minecraft Java Edition (resource packs through data-driven content, structures, biomes, mob animations).
- The main session answered with a six-layer breakdown:
  1. resource packs
  2. data packs
  3. structures
  4. worldgen
  5. custom blocks, items and entities with behaviour
  6. models and animations
- It also covered three things:
  - the code-generation vs runtime-engine trade-off, with a hybrid recommended
  - modularity principles: a version-agnostic IR, schema-driven editors, per-version targets and a plugin API
  - a rough phased roadmap
- It named the competitors: MCreator, Blockbench and the Misode generators.

**Decisions (user)**
- Fabric first, with vanilla-only pack export as an option.
- Desktop application.
- For both beginners and power users.
- Solo developer; tech stack left to the agents.
- Workflow: Fable as orchestrator, Opus at medium effort as executor.
- Keep a devlog, and split CLAUDE.md into multiple scoped files to save tokens.

**Next**
- Produce the design document, roadmap, scoped CLAUDE.md files and agent definitions.

## 2026-11-03 — orchestrator (Fable) — Architecture and writing briefs

**What**
- Verified the external facts by web search:
  - Minecraft Java uses year-based versions since 26.1. The current release is 26.3 (15 Sep 2026).
  - 26.1+ is unobfuscated and needs JDK 25.
  - Fabric uses a non-remapping Loom variant for 26.1+.
  - GeckoLib 5.5+ supports 26.1.
  - SpyglassMC `vanilla-mcdoc` tracks 26.3.
- Produced the architecture decisions and literal briefs for 17 files, split into 4 parallel executor batches with no file overlap.
- Froze the 19 DESIGN.md H2 headings and their anchors so every cross-link stays stable.

**Decisions**
- **Names:** MSM (`@msm/*`, mod id `msm_runtime`, Java package `dev.mcsupermods.runtime`).
- **Minecraft target:** 26.3 primary. Support the current release and the previous one (N and N-1). No pre-26.1 support in v1.
- **App:** Electron rather than Tauri. One language, reliable WebGL, and the Node ecosystem: Spyglass, deepslate, prismarine-nbt.
- **Monorepo:** React 19, TypeScript strict, Zustand, Immer command stack with JSON patches, Radix + Tailwind, Monaco, three.js + deepslate, pnpm + Turborepo, Vitest, Biome.
- **Engine mod:** Java 25, Fabric with Mojang names. Definitions in `msm/` are scanned at init because registries freeze. The runtime jar is nested inside each exported content jar.
- **Behaviour model:** Bedrock-style components and events defined once in MSM mcdoc schemas, consumed by both the app and the runtime.
- **Escape hatches:**
  - Tier 0: no-code components.
  - Tier 1: TypeScript scripts transpiled with esbuild and run by Rhino in-game.
  - Tier 2: one-way eject to a Fabric Java project.
- **Project format:** a git-friendly directory with one JSON file per element and sorted keys.
- **Roadmap:** 8 phases, about 43–58 focused solo weeks. The MVP (Phase 1) is Resource Pack Studio only. Phase 4 opens with a registry-freeze spike.

**Next**
- Dispatch the executor batches.

## 2026-11-03 — executors (Opus, medium effort) x4 — Documentation batches

**What**
- **Batch A:** `docs/DESIGN.md`, 5,488 words, 19 sections exactly as frozen.
- **Batch B:** `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `README.md`, `docs/CLAUDE.md`.
- **Batch C:** root `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md`, `.claude/agents/executor.md`, `app/CLAUDE.md`, `engine-mod/CLAUDE.md`.
- **Batch D:** seven scoped guides under `packages/` (core, schemas, plugin-api, plugins, exporters, targets, interop).
- Reported deviations were minor:
  - multi-phase status lines
  - placeholder component ids (`msm:redstone`, `msm:tool`, ...)
  - the ROADMAP raw word count slightly over target because of table and checkbox markup
  - a few extra conventions added, such as no reuse of ADR numbers

**Decisions**
- None beyond the orchestrator plan. The placeholder component ids are provisional until the MSM mcdoc schemas are written in Phase 4.

---

## 2026-11-03 — main session — Review and commit

**What**
- Ran the orchestrator's acceptance checks. All passed:
  - DESIGN.md has 19 H2 headings matching the frozen list.
  - Every `DESIGN.md#anchor` link in every Markdown file resolves.
  - Root CLAUDE.md is 67 lines (limit 70). Every scoped CLAUDE.md is 55 lines or fewer.
  - No emojis.
- Wrote this devlog and committed everything to branch `ccr-d077e76e-4gnbx2`.

**Next (Phase 0 — Foundations; see docs/ROADMAP.md)**
- The orchestrator writes Phase 0 briefs:
  - the monorepo skeleton (pnpm, Turborepo, Biome, tsconfig, CI)
  - `@msm/plugin-api` interfaces
  - `@msm/core` IR with project load/save and the command stack
  - `@msm/schemas` loading vanilla-mcdoc for 26.3
  - the Electron shell opening and saving a project
- Resolve the open questions due in Phase 0: the exact Electron, Node and Loom versions, and the mcmeta branch naming.
- Choose a licence (open question in DESIGN.md section 18).

---

## 2026-11-04 — orchestrator (Fable) — Phase 0 plan

**What**
- Read the root CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP Phase 0, DESIGN sections 3–7, 9 and 14–19, and the scoped guides.
- Wrote 8 implementation briefs (B01, B02, B04–B09; B03 was merged into B07) in 4 dependency-ordered waves, with no file shared within a wave. Each brief listed exact APIs, tests, acceptance commands and what was out of scope.

**Decisions** (pinned and checked against npm and the upstream repos)
- **Toolchain:** Node ≥22.18, pnpm 10.28 with a catalog, TypeScript 6.0.3 (7.x is the Go port and the tooling is not ready), Vite 8, electron-vite 6, Vitest 5, Biome 2.6, Turborepo 2.11, React 19.3, Electron 45.2.2.
- **Internal packages:** source-first, typechecked with `tsc -b` project references.
- **vanilla-mcdoc:** it has no tags, so we pin a commit sha. Phase 0 consumes the vendored Spyglass symbol export; the Spyglass Service is deferred to Phase 1.
- **mcmeta:** refs are the tags `26.3-summary` and `26.3-registries`.
- **26.3 pack formats:** resource 97.1, data 121.0 (verified).
- **App:** core runs in the renderer. The main process implements `PlatformAdapter` over zod-validated, versioned IPC.
- **IR types** live in `@msm/plugin-api`; their behaviour lives in `@msm/core`.
- **Licence:** left for the user (MIT proposed).

---

## 2026-11-04 — executors (Opus, medium effort) — Phase 0 implementation

**What** (main session verified and committed each wave in turn)
- **Wave 1, B01:** the monorepo skeleton:
  - pnpm workspace and catalog, Turborepo, Biome, `tsconfig` project references
  - CI workflow
  - `tools/check-deps`: enforces the layer map and rejects any `26.<n>` literal outside `packages/targets`
  - stub packages
- **Wave 2:**
  - **B02:** `@msm/plugin-api` 0.1.0, with the full public surface and `definePlugin`.
  - **B04:** `tools/sync-mcdoc` and `tools/sync-mcmeta`, plus vendored 26.3 data (4.4 MB). mcdoc-cli 0.1.63 build mode produced an empty export. The fix is an `env.dependencies` entry in the temporary checkout, and the output is now byte-identical to upstream.
  - **B05:** `@msm/schemas`: the `SchemaNode` model, `since`/`until` version gating, a lazy memoised schema index, and a fixture subset.
- **Wave 3:**
  - **B06:** `@msm/core`:
    - a deterministic sorted-key serialiser
    - an injected file system with an in-memory version
    - load, save and migrators
    - the element kind registry
    - an Immer command stack with RFC 6902 patches, undo/redo and dirty tracking
    - golden round-trip fixtures
  - **B07:** `@msm/target-mc-26.3`: the target facts and the "26.3 schemas load" exit-criterion test (2,105 types, loads in about 95 ms).
- **Wave 4:**
  - **B08:** `@msm/app` Electron shell:
    - sandboxed renderer and CommonJS preload
    - project-scoped file system in the main process
    - new, open and save; element list; raw JSON editor; problems panel; undo/redo
    - a headless smoke run under xvfb
  - **B09:** ADRs 0001–0008. DESIGN sections 5, 6, 9, 14, 15 and 18 corrected to match the implementation (including the incorrect "tag exists" claim in §6). Four scoped CLAUDE.md files refreshed.

**Decisions**
- **Data-loss risk found by B06.** Load skips invalid element files, and save deletes `content/*.json` files it did not write. The main session decided that for Phase 0 the app refuses to save while error-severity problems exist; B08 implemented this with a test. The permanent fix is DESIGN Q9, for Phase 1.
- Only one executor per wave may change `pnpm-lock.yaml`, so parallel executors don't produce conflicting lockfiles.

---

## 2026-11-04 — main session — Phase 0 review and close

**What**
- Ran the exit criteria on a clean install, and all passed:
  - `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm lint` (Biome and check-deps), `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` and `pnpm build`
  - `pnpm --filter @msm/app smoke` exits 0
  - 8 ADRs; DESIGN still has 19 H2 headings
- Tests: 203 in total.

| Package | Tests |
|---|---|
| core | 109 |
| schemas | 27 |
| app | 26 |
| tools | 23 |
| plugin-api | 11 |
| target | 7 |

- Ticked the `@msm/app` box in ROADMAP and added a Phase 0 row to the Milestone Log.
- Updated the status lines in the README, root CLAUDE.md, `docs/CLAUDE.md` and `app/CLAUDE.md`.
- Added the Electron binary download and the xvfb smoke step to CI. The CI workflow has not yet run on GitHub.

**Open / Next**
- **Licence:** awaiting the user (MIT proposed). The Phase 0 release is left untagged until it is decided.
- **Phase 1 carry-overs:**
  - the permanent fix for the save-time data loss
  - symlink containment in the scoped file system
  - a shared path-validation module for core and app
  - live problems and clearing the save block
  - concrete and template mcdoc types (`ItemStack`), which currently normalise to `unsupported`
  - a `keyType` on `'*'` fields
  - `typescript` devDependencies in plugin-api, schemas and target
- **Next:** the orchestrator plans Phase 1, Resource Pack Studio.

---

## 2026-11-04 — orchestrator (Fable) — Phase 1 plan

**What**
- Planned Phase 1 (Resource Pack Studio): 6 waves, 20 briefs (B10–B29), with one lockfile owner per wave.

**Decisions** (ADRs 0009–0013)
- **Validation:** an MSM structural validator over `SchemaNode` serves as both the live check and the export gate; Spyglass is deferred to Phase 2.
- **Preview:** deepslate's own renderer, no three.js. Seven MSM-authored fallback parent models.
- **Asset extraction:** client-jar assets are extracted in the main process into `~/.msm/cache/assets/<version>/`, tested with a synthetic jar.
- **Save:** save deletes only the files it loaded (`SaveManifest`), which resolves DESIGN Q9. Save is never blocked; errors block export only.
- **Toolchain:** plugin-api 0.2.0, a `@msm/targets` aggregator, electron-builder 26.18, and version pins for deepslate, Monaco, Tailwind 4, Radix and fflate.

---

## 2026-11-04 — executors (Opus, medium effort) — Phase 1 implementation

**What** (main session verified and committed each brief separately)
- **Wave 1:**
  - B10 plugin-api 0.2.0
  - B11 schema generics, tuples, `keyType`, tags. Unsupported nodes in Phase 1 kinds dropped from 28 to 3.
  - B13 workspace plumbing and the `tools/new-plugin` scaffold
  - B16 ADRs 0009–0013
- **Wave 2:**
  - B12 `validateJson` and the registry index
  - B14 client-jar extraction, with path-traversal and zip-bomb guards
  - B15 the targets aggregator
  - B17 core save manifest, `setElementValue` with typing coalescing, asset commands, `lowerProject`
- **Wave 3:**
  - B18 exporters: deterministic zip (identical in every timezone), the validation gate, `vanilla-packs`
  - B19 six resource-pack kinds with golden fixtures validated against the real 26.3 schemas
  - B20 main-process IPC domains and symlink containment
  - B21 Tailwind/Radix shell with lazy Monaco
- **Wave 4:**
  - B22 `SchemaForm` generator
  - B23 session integration: live problems, manifest save, assets, export and install
  - B24 deepslate preview with fallback parents
  - B25 Windows installer config, release workflow, Playwright harness
- **Wave 5:**
  - B26 Studio wiring: forms, preview, templates, import with thumbnails, language and pack studios, settings with asset extraction, problem navigation, undoable asset removal through `.msm/trash`
  - B27 sample resource pack (self-made textures, `minecraft:stick` override), exporter SHA-256 golden, README "Try it"
  - B28 golden-path e2e, CI e2e, packaged smoke and size steps, `tools/check-size`
- **Wave 6:**
  - B29 docs sync, ROADMAP ticks, Milestone Log
- **Extra fixes from the main session:**
  - The validator accepts `minecraft:`-prefixed dispatcher keys.
  - Enum discriminators with no dispatcher member (such as item model `empty`) validate.
  - Clipped sidebar row actions fixed.
  - Problem navigation focuses map-entry values.

**Decisions**
- **User: Windows-only releases.** macOS is dropped and not planned. The Linux `dir` build is used only for verification.
- **Main session decisions:**
  - Production CSP keeps `style-src 'unsafe-inline'`, because Monaco and Radix inject runtime styles. Scripts stay `'self'`.
  - The seven fallback parents are self-authored and acceptable (Q12, pending a user veto).
  - Asset removal is undoable through `.msm/trash`, which is emptied on open or create.
  - Exporters may use the resourcepack plugin in tests only.
  - Size budgets replace the unachievable "150 MB unpacked" rule:
    - asar ≤ 25 MB
    - renderer ≤ 8 MB, with no renderer JSON over 100 kB
    - Windows installer ≤ 150 MB
- **Process:** GitHub push returned transient HTTP 500s twice. They were retried with backoff and nothing was lost.

---

## 2026-11-04 — main session — Phase 1 review and close

**What**
- Ran the Phase 1 exit criteria on a clean install, and all passed:
  - `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test` and `build`
  - xvfb smoke and e2e: 2 tests, golden path about 2.4 s, stable over 3 runs
  - `dist:dir`, then the packaged smoke test
  - `check-size`: asar 10.2 MB, renderer 5.6 MB
  - 13 ADRs; DESIGN still has 19 H2 headings
  - no `26.<n>` literal outside `packages/targets` (only the exempt dev scripts in `tools/`)
  - no Mojang files or jars tracked
- Tests: 629 in total.

| Package | Tests |
|---|---|
| app | 178 |
| core | 139 |
| schemas | 97 |
| tools | 52 |
| exporters | 47 |
| plugin-api | 41 |
| interop | 31 |
| resourcepack | 27 |
| targets aggregator | 9 |
| mc-26.3 | 8 |

- Estimated Windows installer size is about 122 MB. It cannot be built here (no wine), and neither the CI nor the release workflow has run on GitHub yet.

**Open / Next**
- **Needs the user:**
  - Licence (MIT proposed). This blocks the `v0.1.0` tag.
  - Auto-update: make this repo public, or use a separate public releases repo.
  - In-game check on Windows with Minecraft 26.3: install the sample pack and hold a stick.
  - The Q12 fallback-parent policy (veto or accept).
- **Next:** the orchestrator plans Phase 2, Data Pack Studio, including the Phase 2 carry-overs listed in ROADMAP.

---

## 2026-11-04 — main session — User decisions: licence, visibility, auto-update, Windows only

**Decisions (user)**
- **Licence:** MIT for the whole repository, "free to use but must be credited". Credit comes through the retained copyright notice. `LICENSE` is at the root with "Copyright (c) 2026 MEZTKING and MCSuperMods contributors", and every `package.json` has `"license": "MIT"`. Packs made with MCSuperMods belong to their authors.
- **Repository:** will be made public. The user does this in GitHub settings; it cannot be done from this session.
- **Auto-update:** `electron-updater` with the GitHub provider on public Releases. The dependency is pinned (6.8.11) and implementation is scheduled in Phase 2. DESIGN Q4 and Q10 are resolved.
- **Platforms:** Windows-only releases (decided earlier); macOS is not planned for now.

**What**
- The user asked what the "stick test" is. It is the manual Phase 1 in-game check: install `fixtures/sample-resourcepack`, enable it in Minecraft 26.3, and hold a stick, which should render as a ruby. It is documented in README "Try it" and is still pending with the user.

---

## 2026-11-04 — orchestrator (Fable) + main session — Phase 2 plan and environment

**What**
- The orchestrator planned Phase 2, Data Pack Studio: 5 waves, 18 briefs (B30–B47).
- An offline Spyglass spike proved mcfunction parse, check, lint and completion work without network access.
- Main session installed Node 24.22.2 at `/opt/node24`, after checking its SHA-256 against nodejs.org, with shims in `/root/.local/bin` placed first on PATH. Corepack is enabled. The repository was green on Node 24 before any change.

**Decisions** (ADRs 0014–0017)
- **ADR 0014:** Spyglass runs mcfunction checking only, in the main process, behind IPC. JSON validation stays `validateJson`. Spyglass's JSON checker is not adopted (Q13).
- **ADR 0015, data pack model:**
  - functions are stored as `{ lines }` and lowered to `.mcfunction` with `OutputFile.language`;
  - tags are kinds named `minecraft:tag/<registry>`;
  - `pack.mcmeta` lowers to both layers;
  - combined export is two zips in a folder the user picks;
  - world install goes to `saves/<world>/datapacks/`.
- **ADR 0016:** a reference index, plus a rename that rewrites references in JSON and in function lines as one undo step.
- **ADR 0017:** Node 24 and pnpm 12 now, plugin-api 0.3.0, Spyglass version pins.
- **Main session defaults the user may overrule:**
  - Loot Table and Advancement use the schema form plus templates; a bespoke studio is deferred.
  - Two-zip combined export.

---

## 2026-11-04 — executors (Opus, medium effort) — Phase 2 waves 1–3

**What** (each brief verified and committed by the main session)
- **Wave 1:**
  - **B30:** Node 24 and pnpm 12.16.1 (`allowBuilds` replaces `onlyBuiltDependencies`); three just-published packages exempted from the release-age rule; `pnpm/action-setup@v6`; Spyglass and `electron-updater` dependencies; datapack scaffold; vendored mcmeta command tree (583 kB, kept readable) and block states; MIT fields in every package.
  - **B31:** plugin-api 0.3.0, adding `OutputFile.language`, `Problem.range` and `Target.folders.data` (17 keys, checked against the Spyglass binder).
  - **B32:** `tag:<registry>` refs, the `msm:function` extension, modelled `indexed` types and generic dispatchers, and `collectReferences`. All 77 vanilla resource kinds now normalise with zero unsupported nodes.
  - **B33:** ADRs 0014–0017 and the matching DESIGN and ROADMAP updates.
- **Wave 2:**
  - **B34:** the offline Spyglass mcfunction service. Init about 380 ms, a typical check 3–10 ms. Two fixes to the spike recipe: `ctx` must carry `loadedVersion` (otherwise item components are flagged falsely), and `BrowserExternals` is not exported, so a local offline externals object is used.
  - **B35:** 14 data pack kinds (recipe, loot table, advancement, predicate, item modifier, function, 8 tag registries) and a dual-layer `pack.mcmeta`. 26.3 shapes are used: loot conditions and functions use `type`, and pools use `condition`/`modifier`.
  - **B36:** the core reference index, text references and `renameElement`.
  - **B37:** the data pack exporter, combined file names, and the `validateText` hook on export.
- **Wave 3** (so far):
  - **B38:** main-process mcfunction broker (asar +1.1 MB rather than the estimated 3.5 MB), `listWorlds`, `installDataPack`, and `exports.pickFolder`/`writeFiles` restricted to folders the user picked.
  - **B39:** session support — datapack plugin registration, live mcfunction problems, references and rename, data pack export, 12 templates in 26.3 shapes, and `#minecraft:tick`/`#minecraft:load` seeded as known.
  - **B41:** ten tier-B kinds (enchantment, damage type, dimension type, chat type, jukebox song, banner pattern, painting variant, trim material, trim pattern, dialog).
  - **B40** (studio components) is still running.
- **Validator fixes found against real 26.3 data** (main-session follow-up briefs):
  - `minecraft:`-prefixed ids are accepted on `#[id]` enums (for example a loot table's `type`).
  - Registered ids with no dispatcher member (for example `survives_explosion`) count as having no extra fields.
  - `#[id(path=…)]` prefixes are kept (`idPath`), so banner, painting and trim texture ids validate.
  - Unknown fields under dispatcher spreads are now reported; the dialog type previously accepted anything.

**Decisions**
- `commands.json` stays pretty-printed (583 kB) for readable diffs.
- Mid-wave coordination is done by main-session messages. One stale instruction to B41 was applied before it could be cancelled; the result was correct and committed.

**Next**
- Wave 4: B42 Studio wiring, B43 animated textures, B44 Spyglass symbols inside commands, B45 sample data pack.
- Wave 5: B46 data pack e2e, B47 docs sync.
- Auto-update brief: add to wave 4 or 5.

---

## 2026-11-04 — main session — Phase 2 wave 3 close

**What**
- **B40 landed:**
  - **Field-position dispatchers in SchemaForm**, using a sibling or `%key` discriminator. `environment_attribute_check.value` and `%key` component values now render as proper forms instead of JSON.
  - **Id inputs:** `IdInput` with `#tag` suggestions.
  - **RecipeStudio:** a 3×3 shaped grid with automatic key letters, shapeless and cooking editors, and an "advanced" toggle to the schema form.
  - **TagStudio:** a `replace` toggle and optional entries.
  - **FunctionEditor:** lazy Monaco with an mcfunction Monarch tokenizer, problem markers from `/lines/<n>` plus `range`, and snippet completions. The textarea fallback has Ctrl+Space completion.
  - **CommandPalette** and **WorldPickerDialog**.
  - **form-coverage test:** every member of the six key dispatchers renders without a JSON fallback.
- Removed stray `zz-explore` test files left by executors.
- Verified: lint, typecheck and `pnpm test` are green. App tests: 296.

**Decisions**
- Recipe `category` suggestions come from the schema (B42), not from values hard-coded in the app, because they are version facts.
- The components are presentational; B42 connects them to the session and store.

**Next**
- Wave 4: B42 Studio wiring, B43 animated textures, B44 Spyglass symbols for JSON/NBT inside commands, B45 sample data pack.
- Auto-update brief (B48) runs alongside wave 4.

---

## 2026-11-04 — main session — Phase 2 wave 4 close

**What** (each brief verified and committed)
- **B45 sample data pack** (`fixtures/sample-datapack`), the input for the user's in-game check:
  - a `greet` function and a `#minecraft:load` message;
  - shaped, shapeless and smelting recipes;
  - an advancement granted by `recipe_crafted` (26.3 uses `recipes`, not `recipe_id`), a loot table, a predicate and an item modifier;
  - every function has zero mcfunction problems;
  - data and resource zip SHA-256 goldens, identical in Kiritimati and Los Angeles time;
  - README "Try the data pack".
- **B44 mcdoc symbols inside commands:**
  - Text components, item components and entity NBT are type-checked when the service gets the vanilla-mcdoc export.
  - MSM checks block-state properties itself, because Spyglass parses but never checks them.
  - Fixed missing `setParents`, which had broken every parent-walking completer, including block-state completion.
  - Main chunk grew by 40 kB. Init assertion relaxed to 5 s (measured about 0.4 s, 1.0 s under load).
- **B43 animated textures:**
  - `.png.mcmeta` is extracted from the client jar.
  - Project sidecars pass the export gate as `resource:texture_meta`.
  - The preview steps through frames with a scrubber (play, pause, previous, next, slider).
- **B42 Data Pack Studio wiring:**
  - Routing: recipes open in RecipeStudio, tags in TagStudio, functions in FunctionEditor.
  - Export: a split Export button and Export/Install menus with disabled reasons; resource or data zip; both packs into a folder the user picks; data pack install into a world through the world picker.
  - File and Edit menu commands, plus F2 rename with a reference count and Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P command palette.
  - Find usages, go to definition, problem navigation to a line, `idPath`-aware completions, and per-gesture undo for recipe-grid edits.
- **Verification on the combined tree:**
  - lint, typecheck and test (11 packages, app 359 tests), build
  - e2e 2/2, `dist:dir` and the packaged smoke test
  - `check-size`: asar 12.2 MB of 25 MB, renderer within 8 MB

**Decisions**
- When either pack has errors, every export is disabled. Gating each export separately is a later refinement.
- App wiring for the mcdoc symbols, and adding the `@spyglassmc/json` and `nbt` packages for completions inside JSON and NBT, go in a wave 5 brief (B49).
- Old asset caches made before sidecar extraction won't contain sidecars. Bumping `AssetCacheInfo.schemaVersion` is folded into B49.

**Known gaps** (to document in B47)
- Go to definition inside Monaco cannot read the caret yet; it works from form fields and the textarea editor.
- Problem navigation lands at the start of the line, not the column.
- F2 inside Monaco may also fire Monaco's own rename; to check on Windows.
- The deepslate atlas crops textures to 16×16; true since Phase 1.

**Next**
- Wave 5: B46 data pack e2e, B48 auto-update, B49 mcdoc symbols in the app with JSON/NBT completion and the cache schema bump, then B47 docs sync.

---

## 2026-11-04 — main session — Phase 2 wave 5 (implementation) close

**What** (each brief verified and committed)
- **B49:**
  - The app's mcfunction broker now passes the vanilla-mcdoc symbols, so text and item components and NBT inside commands are type-checked in the running app.
  - Added `@spyglassmc/json` 0.3.61 and `@spyglassmc/nbt` 0.3.63, the versions java-edition pins. When symbols are loaded the service checks the document before completing, because typed completers need that type information. `tellraw @a {"` now suggests `text`, `color` and `bold`, and `{No` suggests `NoAI`.
  - The lazy mcfunction chunk grew by 20 kB.
  - Asset cache schema bumped to 2, so Phase 1 caches without `.png.mcmeta` are re-extracted.
- **B48, auto-update (ADR 0018):**
  - `electron-updater` sits behind an injectable wrapper and is active only in packaged Windows builds outside test runs.
  - The startup check runs 5 s after load (setting `updates.autoCheck`, on by default), plus Help > Check for Updates and a command-palette entry.
  - Updates download in the background. A "Restart to update" banner installs only through the normal close guard, so unsaved work still gets its prompt.
  - The release workflow publishes the installer, blockmap and `latest.yml` to a DRAFT GitHub release, which the user publishes.
  - electron-updater bundles as a 527 kB lazy main chunk and loads from `app.asar`.
- **B46, data pack golden-path e2e:**
  - Covers: a function with a deliberate error, then fixed; a load tag in a new `minecraft` namespace; a shaped recipe from grid cells; rename through the command palette; data and combined export checked with fflate; install into a fake world; reopen.
  - 3 of 3 runs passed, about 7 s each.
- **Bug fixes found by B46** (main-session follow-up):
  - **Fast typing in Monaco could scramble text.** A stale echo of the editor's own value reset the model and the caret. Both Monaco editors now go through `bindControlledModel`, which ignores the editor's own echoes and applies external changes with `pushEditOperations`, keeping the selection. A unit test with a stand-in model reproduces the scramble without the fix. Electron did not reproduce it on demand, so the unit test is the regression guard. The e2e now types into Monaco directly.
  - **New element defaulted to the `minecraft` namespace.** It now uses the last-used namespace, else the first non-`minecraft` one.
- **Verification:**
  - A clean worktree of the committed HEAD typechecks with 0 errors; lint is clean; 11/11 test tasks pass.
  - The working tree passes lint, typecheck and app tests (397). Each executor ran e2e 3/3.
  - asar 12.7 MB of 25 MB.

**Needs the user — first release** (from B48's report, to be put in README by B47)
1. Make `MEZTKING/MCSuperMods` public.
2. Repository Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions: read and write.
3. Set `app/package.json` `version` (currently `0.0.0`, for example `0.1.0`) and commit.
4. Push the tag `v0.1.0`.
5. Check the draft release has the `.exe`, `.blockmap` and `latest.yml`, then press Publish.
6. Install on Windows. SmartScreen will warn because the build is unsigned.

Recommendation: do the in-game checks (Phase 1 stick, Phase 2 data pack) before tagging `v0.1.0`.

**Next**
- B47: docs sync, ROADMAP ticks, Milestone Log, and CLAUDE.md status lines. It must also record: ADR 0010/0011 updates for animated textures; ADR 0014 for checking with symbols and JSON/NBT completion; the stale DESIGN §14 auto-update line; the schemas and plugins CLAUDE.md files; and the known gaps listed in the wave 4 entry.

## 2026-11-04 — main session — Phase 2 review and close

**What**
- B47 docs sync landed:
  - ADR Status lines 0009–0018 record the outcomes.
  - DESIGN §4/§6/§9/§14/§16/§18 now match the implementation.
  - ROADMAP: Phase 2 ticked, a "Phase 2 follow-ups" list under Phase 3, and a Milestone Log row.
  - README: "Releasing" (first-release steps) and "Known limitations".
  - All CLAUDE.md files refreshed.
- Ran the Phase 2 exit criteria on the working tree, and all passed:
  - `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` (pnpm 12.16.1, Node 24.22.2)
  - lint (Biome and check-deps), typecheck, `pnpm test` (11/11 tasks, 1,037 tests), build
  - xvfb smoke
  - e2e: 3/3 specs (smoke, resource-pack golden path, data-pack golden path) in 9.7 s
  - `dist:dir`, then the packaged smoke test; the updater correctly logs "inactive (unsupported-platform)" on Linux
  - `check-size` within budget (asar 12.7 MB)
  - 18 ADRs; DESIGN still has 19 H2 headings
  - no tracked jars; no `26.<n>` literals outside `packages/targets`

**Decisions**
- None new. B47's follow-up is added to the Phase 3 follow-ups: `renameElement` ignores `CollectedReference.written`, so renaming the target of an idPath reference would write the full id. Low risk, but it needs a test.

**Needs the user**
- In-game checks on Windows with Minecraft 26.3:
  - the stick test (`fixtures/sample-resourcepack`);
  - the data pack check (`fixtures/sample-datapack`: `/reload`, `/function msm_sample_data:greet`, craft the ruby block, advancement toast, clean `latest.log`).
- First release: README "Releasing". Make the repository public, then set the version, tag `v0.1.0`, and publish the draft.
- Q12: the fallback-parent policy (veto or accept).

**Next**
- Phase 3, Structures & Worldgen: the orchestrator plans it when the user says go, including the Phase 2 follow-ups list.

## 2026-11-04 — main session — First run on the user's Windows machine

**What**
- The user cloned the repository on Windows and ran the README "Try it" steps. Two problems:
  - `corepack` and `pnpm` were "not recognized" because Node.js was not installed.
  - The clone checked out `main`, which only holds the initial commit; all work is on `ccr-d077e76e-4gnbx2`.
- README "Try it" now gives Windows prerequisites:
  - install Node.js 24 LTS (installer or `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS`), then open a new terminal;
  - `git checkout ccr-d077e76e-4gnbx2` until the work is merged;
  - `npm install -g pnpm@12.16.1` as the non-admin alternative to `corepack enable`;
  - the PowerShell execution-policy fix.

**Next**
- The user retries the setup. Consider merging the development branch into `main` with a pull request, so that cloning gives the current code.

---

## 2026-11-04 — main session — Windows setup, second attempt (Node 26)

**What**
- `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` installed **Node 26.13.0**, the current LTS, not 24.
- The user ran the next commands in the same PowerShell window, so `node`, `npm` and `pnpm` were not on PATH yet. The earlier clone folder was also no longer at `D:\Claude\MCSuperMods\MCSuperMods`.
- Node 25+ no longer bundles corepack (confirmed: the Node 26.13 Linux distribution has no `corepack` binary). README now uses `npm install -g pnpm@12.16.1` as the primary step.
- README "Try it" rewritten:
  - Node 24–26;
  - open a new terminal, or reload PATH in place with a one-liner;
  - `git clone -b ccr-d077e76e-4gnbx2`;
  - the execution-policy note.
- Verified the user's exact flow on Node 26.13.0 (checksum-verified download) in a clean worktree: `npm install -g pnpm@12.16.1`, then `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, typecheck, `pnpm test` (11/11) and build. All pass. The `engines` range `>=24 <27` already covers 26.

**Next**
- The user retries in a fresh terminal. Consider moving `.nvmrc` and CI to Node 26 LTS in Phase 3 (Q11 follow-up), since winget now installs 26.

---

## 2026-11-04 — main session — First release build (v0.1.0, draft)

**What**
- The user asked for an easy `.exe` installer instead of running from source, and chose to let GitHub build it.
- Set `app/package.json` version to `0.1.0` and pushed the tag `v0.1.0` on `ccr-d077e76e-4gnbx2`. This triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml` on `windows-latest`, the first ever Windows run: it builds the NSIS installer and uploads the `.exe`, `.blockmap` and `latest.yml` to a DRAFT release.

**Decisions**
- The draft stays unpublished until the user publishes it. The in-game checks are still recommended first; auto-update starts only after publishing with the repository public.
- **Release attempt:** the tag `v0.1.0` was created locally, but the cloud session's git proxy only allows pushes to the working branch. The tag push was dropped silently ("unexpected disconnect"; `git ls-remote` shows no tags), so the Release workflow never ran. The user pushes the tag from their own clone instead.
- **CI on GitHub was red, and the main session had not been checking it.** Runs 53–55 failed in `@msm/schemas`: the "10,000 validations under 2000 ms" check took 2.8 s on GitHub's runner. It is now an under-10 s guard against pathological slowdowns, since absolute timings vary between machines. From now on the main session checks GitHub CI after pushes, not only local runs.

## 2026-11-04 — main session — v0.1.0 Windows installer built

**What**
- The user pushed the tag `v0.1.0` from their clone, at commit `b7ed264`.
- **Release run #1 (Actions run 41868991772) succeeded** on `windows-latest` in about 2.5 minutes. This was the first ever Windows build.
- electron-builder created the GitHub release `v0.1.0` as a DRAFT and uploaded `MCSuperMods-0.1.0-win-x64.exe` (123,039,273 bytes, within the 150 MB budget) and its `.blockmap`. The workflow artefact `MCSuperMods-windows` holds the `.exe`, `.blockmap` and `latest.yml`.
- **CI is green on GitHub** for both the branch (run 58) and the tag (run 59) after the timing-test fix.

**Next**
- The user downloads the `.exe` from the draft release (SmartScreen warns because the build is unsigned) and tries it, including the stick and data pack in-game checks.
- Publishing the draft, with the repository public, turns on auto-update for later versions.
- Action items, not yet done:
  - move `actions/checkout`, `setup-node` and `upload-artifact` to versions that run on Node 24; GitHub warns that Node 20 actions are deprecated;
  - consider merging the development branch into `main`.
