## 2026-11-03 — main session — Project scoping question

**What**
- The repository contained only a placeholder README.
- The user asked for the scope and feasibility of a full-customisability mod maker for Minecraft Java Edition (resource packs through data-driven content, structures, biomes, mob animations).
- The main session answered with a six-layer breakdown:
  1. resource packs
  2. data packs
  3. structures
  4. worldgen
  5. custom blocks, items and entities with behaviour
  6. models and animations
- It also covered three things:
  - the code-generation vs runtime-engine trade-off, with a hybrid recommended
  - modularity principles: a version-agnostic IR, schema-driven editors, per-version targets and a plugin API
  - a rough phased roadmap
- It named the competitors: MCreator, Blockbench and the Misode generators.

**Decisions (user)**
- Fabric first, with vanilla-only pack export as an option.
- Desktop application.
- For both beginners and power users.
- Solo developer; tech stack left to the agents.
- Workflow: Fable as orchestrator, Opus at medium effort as executor.
- Keep a devlog, and split CLAUDE.md into multiple scoped files to save tokens.

**Next**
- Produce the design document, roadmap, scoped CLAUDE.md files and agent definitions.

## 2026-11-03 — orchestrator (Fable) — Architecture and writing briefs

**What**
- Verified the external facts by web search:
  - Minecraft Java uses year-based versions since 26.1. The current release is 26.3 (15 Sep 2026).
  - 26.1+ is unobfuscated and needs JDK 25.
  - Fabric uses a non-remapping Loom variant for 26.1+.
  - GeckoLib 5.5+ supports 26.1.
  - SpyglassMC `vanilla-mcdoc` tracks 26.3.
- Produced the architecture decisions and literal briefs for 17 files, split into 4 parallel executor batches with no file overlap.
- Froze the 19 DESIGN.md H2 headings and their anchors so every cross-link stays stable.

**Decisions**
- **Names:** MSM (`@msm/*`, mod id `msm_runtime`, Java package `dev.mcsupermods.runtime`).
- **Minecraft target:** 26.3 primary. Support the current release and the previous one (N and N-1). No pre-26.1 support in v1.
- **App:** Electron rather than Tauri. One language, reliable WebGL, and the Node ecosystem: Spyglass, deepslate, prismarine-nbt.
- **Monorepo:** React 19, TypeScript strict, Zustand, Immer command stack with JSON patches, Radix + Tailwind, Monaco, three.js + deepslate, pnpm + Turborepo, Vitest, Biome.
- **Engine mod:** Java 25, Fabric with Mojang names. Definitions in `msm/` are scanned at init because registries freeze. The runtime jar is nested inside each exported content jar.
- **Behaviour model:** Bedrock-style components and events defined once in MSM mcdoc schemas, consumed by both the app and the runtime.
- **Escape hatches:**
  - Tier 0: no-code components.
  - Tier 1: TypeScript scripts transpiled with esbuild and run by Rhino in-game.
  - Tier 2: one-way eject to a Fabric Java project.
- **Project format:** a git-friendly directory with one JSON file per element and sorted keys.
- **Roadmap:** 8 phases, about 43–58 focused solo weeks. The MVP (Phase 1) is Resource Pack Studio only. Phase 4 opens with a registry-freeze spike.

**Next**
- Dispatch the executor batches.

## 2026-11-03 — executors (Opus, medium effort) x4 — Documentation batches

**What**
- **Batch A:** `docs/DESIGN.md`, 5,488 words, 19 sections exactly as frozen.
- **Batch B:** `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `README.md`, `docs/CLAUDE.md`.
- **Batch C:** root `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/agents/orchestrator.md`, `.claude/agents/executor.md`, `app/CLAUDE.md`, `engine-mod/CLAUDE.md`.
- **Batch D:** seven scoped guides under `packages/` (core, schemas, plugin-api, plugins, exporters, targets, interop).
- Reported deviations were minor:
  - multi-phase status lines
  - placeholder component ids (`msm:redstone`, `msm:tool`, ...)
  - the ROADMAP raw word count slightly over target because of table and checkbox markup
  - a few extra conventions added, such as no reuse of ADR numbers

**Decisions**
- None beyond the orchestrator plan. The placeholder component ids are provisional until the MSM mcdoc schemas are written in Phase 4.

## 2026-11-03 — main session — Review and commit

**What**
- Ran the orchestrator's acceptance checks. All passed:
  - DESIGN.md has 19 H2 headings matching the frozen list.
  - Every `DESIGN.md#anchor` link in every Markdown file resolves.
  - Root CLAUDE.md is 67 lines (limit 70). Every scoped CLAUDE.md is 55 lines or fewer.
  - No emojis.
- Wrote this devlog and committed everything to branch `ccr-d077e76e-4gnbx2`.

**Next (Phase 0 — Foundations; see docs/ROADMAP.md)**
- The orchestrator writes Phase 0 briefs:
  - the monorepo skeleton (pnpm, Turborepo, Biome, tsconfig, CI)
  - `@msm/plugin-api` interfaces
  - `@msm/core` IR with project load/save and the command stack
  - `@msm/schemas` loading vanilla-mcdoc for 26.3
  - the Electron shell opening and saving a project
- Resolve the open questions due in Phase 0: the exact Electron, Node and Loom versions, and the mcmeta branch naming.
- Choose a licence (open question in DESIGN.md section 18).
